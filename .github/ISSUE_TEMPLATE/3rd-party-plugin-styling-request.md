<!--
Note:
- The plugin must be appearing in the [Joplin Plugin Repository](https://github.com/joplin/plugins)
- ReMoods cannot style the private panel of other plugins, please make sure your request is targeted to only the Markdown Editor and Render Viewer.
- I wouldn't keep testing every 3rd-party plugin in the future, so I will only fix problems based on your report.
